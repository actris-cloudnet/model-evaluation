This module will be used same way as in Cloudnetpy? Interface witch gives tools
for netcdf reading and gathering data. In here might also be class for model
files reading. Needs still same thinking what's going on

There will be different type of data reading, grib, nc, etc. so every of those
will probably get own class.

Reading observation
Reading different kind of models
Goal is to get as similar information as possible from each model
